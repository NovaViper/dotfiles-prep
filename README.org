#+title: SSH Setup

This repo is a competent of my dotfiles installer; it runs through and sets up the prerequisites that installer requires before continuing the installation.

The important detail is to not forget to source the script with the following command in the terminal:
#+begin_src sh
source ./setup.sh
#+end_src

This is important because the environment variables it exports will not save once the script finishes running!!
